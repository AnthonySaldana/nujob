## How to Run the Script

To run the automated job application script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the script by running:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

This will execute the script and begin the automated job application process using Puppeteer and OpenAI.
